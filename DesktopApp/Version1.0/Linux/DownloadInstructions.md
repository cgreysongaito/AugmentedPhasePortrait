Linux Dowloading Instructions 

1. Download MATLAB RUNTIME from https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html
2. Unzip the RUNTIME .zip file, and navigate into the new folder with all the RUNTIME files.
3. Use ./install (or sudo ./install if installing into a place with root access) to install MatLab Runtime.
4. Follow the prompts in the installation process. Record the location where MatLab RUNTIME was installed. Recommendation is to install RUNTIME in the same parent folder containing the folder of the AugmentedPhasePlane application.
5. Navigate into the AugmentedPhasePlane folder.
6. Use ./run_AugmentedPhasePlane.sh /path/to/R2023b/   (where/path/to/R2023b/ is the absolute path to the R2023b runtime that you installed)
7. The program AugmentedPhasePlane should now be running.
